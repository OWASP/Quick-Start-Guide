The Application Security Program Quick Start Guide
==================================================

### Preface

This guide is intended to be a short, straightforward introductory guide
to standing-up or improving an Application Security Program1. The
intended goal of the AppSec program is to implement measures throughout
the codeâ€™s life-cycle to prevent gaps in the application security policy
or the underlying system through flaws in the design, development,
deployment, upgrade, or maintenance of the application.

The application security program should effectively manage the security
of its application systems, protecting information from unauthorized
access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in
order to provide integrity, confidentiality and availability.

A fundamental component of this improved application security management
is the ability to demonstrate acceptable levels of risk based on defined
KPIs, including but limited to:

1.  The number of vulnerabilities present in an application
2.  The time to fix vulnerabilities
3.  The remediation rate of vulnerabilities
4.  The time vulnerabilities remain open

The application security program deliverables include a holistic view of
the state of security for each application, identifying the risks
associated with the application and the countermeasures implemented to
mitigate those risks, explaining how security is implemented, planning
for system downtimes and emergencies, and providing a formal plan to
improve the security in one or more of these areas.

### Audience

The intended audience of this document is anyone from security
engineers, developers, program managers, senior managers or a senior
executive. This guide should be considered the start of a comprehensive
approach, it is intended to give the basic questions and answers that
should be asked by those who are in charge of the application security
program in your organization, this includes those responsible for
managing the risk of the entire organization.
